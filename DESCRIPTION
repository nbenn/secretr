Package: secretr
Title: Secure storage of user credentials
Description: Using password protected services from R either requires repeated
    manual entry of user credentials which is cumbersome and precludes
    non-interactive application, or might often rely on insecure workarounds,
    such as plain-text storage. This package attempts to remedy this situation
    through use of OS services such as keychain on Mac OS X, or Gnome Seahorse
    on compatible Linux distributions.
